# PFR_differential_equation_optimisation
This project involved the optimisation of temperature (initially assuming constant temperature, then moving to more complex linear and nonlinear variations in temperature) to achieve the maximum output concentration of component C, from the competing reactions for the production of A, B and C. This involved the construction of differential equations for the change of concentration for each component throughout the reactor, based on each components rate equation (treating the rate constants as variable based on the temperature within the reactor). This project made use of numerical ode solvers (ode15s) and optimisation algorithms such as fmincon (which makes use of algorithms such as conjugate gradient and gradient descent) and lsqnonlin (non linear least squares solver)
