# PFR_differential_equation_optimisation
This project involved the optimisation of temperature to achieve the maximum output concentration of component C, from the competing equations for the production of A, B and C. This involved the construction of differential equations for the change of concentration for each component throughout the reactor, based on each components rate equation (treating the rate constants as variable based on the temperature within the reactor).
